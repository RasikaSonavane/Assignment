//21. Compound Assignment With Augmented Division:
//Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the /= operator.

var a=1
var b=9
var c=2

a/=2
console.log(a)
b/=7
console.log(b)
c/+9
console.log(c)

//22. Declare String Variables:
var myFirstName="Rasika"
var myLastName="Sonavane"
 
//23. Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings:
/*Use backslashes to assign a string to the myStr variable so that if you were to print it to the console, you would see:
I am a "double quoted" string inside "double quotes"*/

var myStr ="I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\"";
console.log(myStr)

//24. Quoting Strings with Single Quotes:
//Change the provided string to a string with single quotes at the beginning and end and no escape characters.
var conversation = 'Finn exclaims to Jake, "Algebraic!"'
console.log(conversation)

//25.  Escape Sequences in Strings:
/*Assign the following three lines of text into the single variable myStr using escape sequences.
FirstLine
    \SecondLine
ThirdLine*/

var myStr='FirstLine \n   \\SecondLine\nThirdLine'
console.log(myStr)

//26. Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator:
var myStr = "This is the start." +  "and This is the end."
console.log(myStr)

//27. Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator:
var myStr="This is the first sentence. "
myStr+="and This is the second sentence."
console.log(myStr)

//28. Constructing Strings with Variables:
//Set myName to a string equal to your name and build myStr with myName between the strings My name is and and I am well
var myName="Rasika"
var myStr="My Name is " + myName + " and I am well"
console.log(myStr)

//29. Appending Variables to Strings:
thisStr=" This is Awesome"
myStr="Enjoy it"

myStr+=thisStr
console.log(myStr)

//30.  Use Bracket Notation to Find the First Character in a String
/*Use bracket notation to find the first character in the lastName variable 
and assign it to firstLetterOfLastName*/

lastName="Sonavane"
var firstLetterOfLastName=lastName[0]
console.log(firstLetterOfLastName)
